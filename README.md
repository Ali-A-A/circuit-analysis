# Circuit Analysis

This web application can solve simple circuits with elements such as resistors, voltage sources, and current sources.
I've developed that using **Javascript** and **React** .<br/>
It is responsive and can be used in multiple devices such as mobile or tablet as well as desktop.<br/>
The algorithms in this application are all written in javascript from scratch.<br/>
**It can be used via [this link.](https://ali-a-a.github.io/ec_project)**
